# houdini-utils

This library exposes some low level utilities to use the [houdini APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Houdini_APIs)
as well as a canvas fallback that should be usable with the [paint worklet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Painting_API#the_paint_worklet) that would normally be used by houdini.

Please refer to the [documentation samples](https://microsoft.github.io/fluentui-contrib/houdini-utils/) for usage guidance
