# Fluent UI React V9 - List - Active Element

This example shows how a List component can be used to visualize an active element.

You can use selection and custom styles to display the active element in a specific way. This is useful for scenarios where you want to show the details of the selected item, for example.

In this example, we are also demonstrating how the `onFocus` prop can be utilized to change the selected item immediately upon receiving focus. This allows us to show the details of the selected item in the right panel as user navigates through the list with the keyboard.
